Due to the termination of support Amino.py, I decided to resume support for this project indefinitely.
Therefore, you can expect updates, and full support for the functionality of the Bot and tools.

As soon as there is an update of the library or a crutch for running the code, a large-scale update and a new installation instruction will be released, I ask you to wait a little.
