# Tools and Skeleton for Amino

Hi all, this is a set of tools for creating your own bot for Amino, as well, you can already use the Ram skeleton as the basis for your bot, if you comply with the license conditions

## Installation
It is worth noting beforehand that in order to run the bot or tools it is advisable to use a computer, you can also use a phone, but that is a separate topic I will not cover.
To run it you need to install Python (https://www.python.org/downloads/). You can find an installation guide on YouTube or in an article about it.
Next we need Amino.fix library, why not just Amino.py or Amino.ed? That's easy, we need a working bot and tools, not a useless piece of brick
To install Amino.fix You need:
____
Run CMD as administrator and write
```py
pip uninstall Amino.py #This will remove the Amino.py library if it was previously installed
pip uninstall Amino.ed #This will remove the Amino.ed library if it was previously installed
```
```py
pip install Amino.fix
pip install gTTS
```
Before running the Bot, configure the file, and to run the file type:
```py
python .\Ram1.1.py
```
## That's it!
Now you can safely run the tools and/or Ram

## And I got a startup error, what should I do?
Normally, fatal startup errors can occur to PC/Laptop users

1. it is either related to incorrect installation of Biblioteks (Here it is important to uninstall and install in order).
Or, it may be related to the device ID

# So, let's try to solve your problems!

1. Uninstall everything you have installed, after that, install all dependencies strictly following this instruction
2. You need to switch off internet, then click on "Change password" in the settings, there you will see a long link just above the middle of the screen, copy it to the pc, and separate everything after "deviceid=" without affecting everything after "&sid=". Put this set of characters and numbers into the file device.json (it will appear after the first run), and replace the already existing set of numbers in the variable "device_id": "here is what you separated earlier".

After that, everything should run

## About updates.
Updates will be released only when Ram stops working at all because of the library, or when I have ideas. For now, this project is closed and no updates can be expected

However, if you have any ideas / questions / suggestions / problems, post on my Discord or here and I might be able to update
M remember, I only have two hands! So wait, sooner or later I'll respond
